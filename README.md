# Sudoku-Solver
This project implements a Sudoku solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques. The solver models Sudoku as a CSP with variables, domains, and constraints, and applies backtracking search enhanced with Minimum Remaining Value (MRV) and forward checking to efficiently solve puzzles.
