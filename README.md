# Sudoku-Solver
This project implements a Sudoku solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques. The solver models Sudoku as a CSP with variables, domains, and constraints, and applies backtracking search enhanced with Minimum Remaining Value (MRV) and forward checking to efficiently solve puzzles. 

To run the code, execute : $ python3 sudoku.py <input string>

To generate the test summary from the test sudoku data, execute : $ python3 sudoku tester.py
